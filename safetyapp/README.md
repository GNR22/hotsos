# 📡 Notification Lifecycle: Technical Workflow (supabase workflow)

The core functionality of **HotSOS** is its ability to instantly route an emergency signal from a **victim's device** to a **responder's device**. This process is achieved through coordinated interaction between:

- The **mobile device hardware**
- The **Supabase cloud database**
- The **Expo Push Notification Service**

The workflow ensures that emergency alerts are delivered **in real time**, even when responder applications are running in the background.

---

# 🔁 Step-by-Step Technical Flow

## 1️⃣ The Trigger (Client-Side)

When a user activates the **SOS button**, the application uses the `expo-location` module to retrieve **high-accuracy GPS coordinates** from the device hardware.

The app collects:

- `latitude`
- `longitude`

These coordinates represent the **precise location of the emergency event**.

---

## 2️⃣ Data Persistence (Supabase Database)

Once the coordinates are captured, the application performs an **asynchronous database insertion**.

```sql
INSERT INTO alerts (user_id, latitude, longitude)
VALUES (<user_id>, <latitude>, <longitude>);
```

This record becomes the **official event log**, storing:

- the user who triggered the alert
- the emergency location
- a server-generated timestamp

The **alerts table** acts as the central source of truth for all emergency events.

---

## 3️⃣ Foreground Synchronization (Supabase Realtime)

For responders who currently have the application open, **Supabase Realtime** is used.

Supabase utilizes **WebSockets** to broadcast database changes.

When a new row is inserted into the `alerts` table:

- The database **automatically pushes the update**
- All subscribed clients receive the update
- The **AlertsScreen refreshes instantly**

This removes the need for **manual refresh or polling**.

---

## 4️⃣ Remote Alerting (Push Notifications)

To notify responders whose applications are **closed or running in the background**, HotSOS uses **Expo Push Notifications**.

The process follows a **two-stage notification system**.

### Stage 1: Registry Lookup

The application queries the `profiles` table to retrieve all registered responder **Expo Push Tokens**.

```sql
SELECT push_token FROM profiles;
```

Each token uniquely identifies a device capable of receiving push notifications.

---

### Stage 2: API Dispatch

The victim's device sends a **secure POST request** to the Expo Push API.

```
https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send
```

The request contains:

- push token
- alert message
- optional metadata

---

### Global Routing

Expo acts as a **universal notification bridge**.

The push notification is routed through:

| Platform | Notification Service                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Android  | Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)         |
| iOS      | Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) |

This ensures that responders receive:

- system notifications
- vibration alerts
- lock screen notifications

even if the application is **not currently open**.

---

# ⚠️ Technical Limitations & Boundaries

As a **capstone project using a Backend-as-a-Service architecture**, HotSOS operates within several practical constraints.

---

## 1️⃣ Expo Go "SDK 53" Native Constraint

**Limitation**

Push notifications cannot be tested within the standard **Expo Go application**.

**Technical Context**

Beginning with **Expo SDK 53**, native push notification entitlements were removed from the Expo Go sandbox environment for security reasons.

**Solution**

Testing requires building a **Custom Development Client**.

```
npx eas build --profile development --platform android
```

The generated APK is bundled with the native push notification credentials configured in the Expo Dashboard. This enables the device to communicate with Google's messaging infrastructure without needing the standard Expo Go sandbox.

This enables the device to communicate with **Google's push messaging infrastructure**.

---

## 2️⃣ Mandatory Network Connectivity

**Limitation**

The SOS system requires an **active internet connection**.

**Technical Context**

Supabase operates as a **cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database**, meaning the application must establish a successful **TCP/IP connection** before the alert can be stored.

In **network dead zones**, the database request may fail or time out.

**Future Improvement**

A potential enhancement is implementing an **SMS fallback system** using the `expo-sms` module.

If the cloud API is unreachable, the device could automatically send an emergency text message to trusted contacts.

---

## 3️⃣ Snapshot Location Accuracy

**Limitation**

HotSOS captures a **single location snapshot** during the SOS trigger instead of continuously tracking movement.

**Technical Context**

Modern mobile operating systems enforce strict **background battery optimizations**. Continuous GPS tracking requires:

- "Always On" location permissions
- background task scheduling
- persistent services

These significantly increase **battery consumption and system complexity**.

## 4️⃣ OS-Level Background Restrictions

**Limitation**

On certain Android devices, aggressive battery saving may silence notifications if the app is closed.

**Technical Context**

## This is an OS-level behavior that requires specialized "High Priority" channel configuration and FCM (Firebase) in production builds.

## 5️⃣ Device Compatibility

**Limitation**

The application is not compatible with iPhone (iOS). It is functionally restricted to Android devices.

**Technical Context**

This incompatibility is due to Apple's restrictive ecosystem. Implementing push notifications on iOS requires a paid Apple Developer Program membership and the configuration of APNs (Apple Push Notification service) certificates. Additionally, background GPS tracking on iOS requires different native permissions and background mode handling that are not currently integrated into the HotSOS architecture.

# ⚙️ Essential Database Configuration

To enable **real-time updates** in the application, Supabase replication must be configured.

### Steps

1. Open the **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to:

```
Database → Replication
```

3. Under `supabase_realtime`, enable the **Source toggle** for the `alerts` table.

This configuration allows the database to **stream new rows through WebSockets**, enabling instant updates in the application interface.

---

# 🔧 Past Problems & Technical Bottlenecks

The previous architecture relied on manual Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration, which proved unstable for this project due to the following issues:

## 1. Native Bridge Conflicts
The application attempted to run two execution environments simultaneously:

- JavaScript Thread (Expo/React Native)
- Native Android Firebase SDK

This resulted in:

- Frequent compilation crashes
- `ReferenceError` exceptions
- Native bridge resolution failures
- Inability to properly load the manually configured `google-services.json` file within the Expo development environment

---

## 2. Brittle Native Dependencies

Because the application was tightly coupled with native Android SDKs:

- Minor manifest misconfigurations caused complete startup failures
- Debugging became significantly more difficult
- Development workflow through VS Code was disrupted
- Build consistency decreased across different environments

---

## 3. Failed Notification Triggers

The native Firebase integration failed to properly register the **Emergency Notification Channels** with the Android operating system.

As a result:

- Emergency notifications could not bypass device silence settings
- High-priority visual banners failed to appear consistently
- Alert reliability was reduced during critical situations
- The intended emergency response workflow became ineffective

---

## 4. Network Instability

The application depended on direct and persistent socket connections to a local server instance.

This introduced several issues:

- Frequent connection timeouts
- Unstable communication during network fluctuations
- Repeated `"Network Request Failed"` loops
- Reduced reliability during emergency reporting scenarios

---

# 🔮 Future References & Recommendations

### 🧠 Executive Summary: HotSOS

HotSOS is a real-time, one-tap emergency response system engineered to minimize the critical time gap between incident occurrence and emergency notification. Developed as an undergraduate capstone project, the system utilizes a cloud-native architecture to provide reliable location-based distress alerts for vulnerable individuals.

**Technical Foundation**

The platform is built on a high-performance stack comprising React Native (Expo) for the mobile interface and Supabase (PostgreSQL) for the backend. By leveraging Supabase WebSockets (Realtime), HotSOS ensures that responders receive instantaneous updates without the need for manual refreshing. The notification system utilizes a robust, API-based push architecture—routing alerts through the Expo Push API to Google FCM and Apple APNs—to guarantee delivery even when the application is running in the background.

**Problem Solving & Reliability**

The system addresses common mobile development challenges through:

`Infrastructure Decoupling`: By moving away from brittle, native-linked Firebase configurations, HotSOS now utilizes a cloud-broker API approach, significantly reducing application crashes and startup failures.

`Real-time Synchronization`: The integration of WebSockets eliminates polling delays, ensuring that emergency events are propagated to trusted networks within milliseconds.

`Scalable Architecture`: The platform is designed to handle user location data and emergency network management securely, governed by robust Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Future-Proofing**

While currently an internet-dependent system, the architecture is designed for modular expansion. Future development is prioritized for offline capability enhancements, including SMS fallback protocols for data-poor environments and native FCM re-integration to achieve deeper control over device-level notification behaviors (e.g., overriding DND modes).

HotSOS represents a successful implementation of a scalable, web-connected safety tool that balances developer-friendly maintenance with the stringent reliability required for emergency services.
